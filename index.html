        <p>Excel isn't just for accountants. It's for everybody, including reporters.

        </p><p>Data is like a tipster. We'll see how you can get story ideas. Who's the highest-paid state employee? How many crimes do cops work at Lenox versus Wal-Mart versus Target?
              
        </p><p>But you know tipsters. Even a very useful one isn't always perfect.  You still need to interview humans who know what's going on. For example, there weren't 107 homicides in Atlanta last year, despite what an otherwise useful data set tells us.

        </p><p>Here are some stories where I guarantee you they used a spreadsheet.  The data isn't the whole story, but it was a tipster.

    </p><p>Of course. In this high-profile case, spidey sense and a quick Google search reveals he makes more than this. This data is for FY2016, the year beginning July 1, 2015. So (1) it doesn't cover a full year of his salary. And (2) check with the sports desk on this, but maybe is some of his salary paid by like a foundation or something? Maybe not a straight-up state paycheck? This is something you'd have to check out via reporting.

    </p><p>So those negative salaries and some $0 salaries are a bit of a red flag.  Some are board members who don't get salaries, OK, so that's explicable. And some names, for some reason, are entered twice, once for salary and once for travel.

    <p>But does all this strange data mean the data set is unreliable? 
    
    </p><p>Well, let's go to the end to see how many records there are altogether.

    </p><p>Pro tip: it will take you a long time to scroll. Use a keyboard shortcut to scroll.  It will vary by computer and program and version. Mine is crtl + fn + right arrow. Yours may be crtl + down arrow. You may have to Google your shortcut.

    </p><p>Anyway we have 207,572 records. Of which about 2,300 have negative or $0 salaries. And of those, some are understandable, like board members earning $0. And others might be understandable if we asked about them.

    <p>So, IMHO this is a pretty good 40,000-foot view of salaries, though all of it requires a reality check. It also gives us an idea that in FY 16, "some 207,572" people worked for the state for at least some time. That includes folks from student assistants at colleges to the governor (but it doesn't include K-12 teachers as state employees, which it arguably could.)

    </p><p>Any other story ideas you see in it? 

    </p><p>But it's only a tipsheet. The first time you visit <a href="http://www.open.georgia.gov" target ="_blank">open.georgia.gov</a> to get this data, you have to click "OK" on a note from the state auditor in which he says he's just collecting the data in accordance with Georgia law and does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on it.
    
    </p><p>Indeed, if the data were really faulty and crummy, that itself could be a story. The government tracks a lot of things. Aren't there some data sets out there that would be a story if you found a lot of faults in them?  :)

    <p>Try the same for other addresses, 1801 Howell Mill, 835 Martin Luther King, 3393 Peachtree: two Wal-Marts and Lenox.
    </p><p>You'll get 210, 203 and 405, I hope.

    <p>So yea, now with this, the clickbait fake news shops would write about how DANGER LOOMS at shopping centers because they have "the most" crime, according to "data."  Well, lies, damned lies and statistics.
    
    </p><p>A cooler result, IMHO, is reporters looking into data, seeing stuff that seemed a little weird, and asking police about it. 

    </p><p>Bloomberg found several Wal-Marts with not just tons of shoplifting, but a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-walmart-crime/" target="_blank">troubling amount</a> of violent crime too and plenty of police and local officials who complain about the world's biggest retailer skimping on security. They also get nuanced: is a 24-hour Wal-Mart strictly comparable to a Target that closes at night? 

    </p><p>Macon's WMAZ looked at Bibb County's 911 call log.<a href="http://www.13wmaz.com/news/request-reveals-thousands-of-911-calls-to-walmart/153000548" target="_blank">They found</a> that three Wal-Marts generated more than five times as many calls to deputies than four other sites — two Krogers, a mall and a Target — combined. The comments from the sheriff don't address any differences among stores, but he said that certain places are sometimes a draw for criminals.

    </p><p>And note, both of these stories quote broadly round numbers, "about 5,000 calls,"" etc. Becasue data sets are just a 40,000-foot view. You still have to get to the ground to see the real details.
