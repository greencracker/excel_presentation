        <p>Excel isn't just for accountants. It's for everybody, including reporters.

        </p><p>Data is like a tipster. We'll see how you can get story ideas. Who's the highest-paid state employee? How many crimes do cops work at Lenox versus Wal-Mart versus Target?
              
        </p><p>But you know tipsters. Even a very useful one isn't always perfect.  You still need to interview humans who know what's going on. For example, there weren't 107 homicides in Atlanta last year, despite what an otherwise useful data set tells us.

        </p><p>Here are some stories where I guarantee you they used a spreadsheet.  The data isn't the whole story, but it was a tipster.

    </p><p>Of course. In this high-profile case, spidey sense and a quick Google search reveals he makes more than this. This data is for FY2016, the year beginning July 1, 2015. So (1) it doesn't cover a full year of his salary. And (2) check with the sports desk on this, but maybe is some of his salary paid by like a foundation or something? Maybe not a straight-up state paycheck? This is something you'd have to check out via reporting.

    <p>Does it matter that some of the records make no sense?  Is this still reliable?
    
    </p><p>Well, let's go to the end to see how many records there are altogether.

    </p><p>Pro tip: it will take you a long time to scroll. Use a keyboard shortcut to scroll.  It will vary by computer and program and version. Mine is crtl + fn + right arrow. Yours may be crtl + down arrow. You may have to Google your shortcut.

    </p><p>Anyway we have 207,572 records. Of which about 2,300 have negative or $0 salaries. And of those, some are understandable, like board members earning $0. And others might be understandable if we asked about them.

    <p>So, I'd say, yea, this is a pretty good 40,000-foot view of salaries, though all of it requires a reality check. It also gives us an idea that in FY 16, "some" 207,572 people worked for at least a day for the state. That includes folks from student assistants at colleges to the governor (but it doesn't include K-12 teachers, which it arguably could.)

    </p><p>Any other story ideas you see in it? 

    </p><p>But it's only a tipsheet. The first time you visit this site, you have to click "OK" on a note from the state auditor in which he says he's just collecting the data in accordance with Georgia law and does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on it.
